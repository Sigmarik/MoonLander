## Controls

- **Left / Right arrows:** rotate the ship,
- **Space:** activate ship's thrusters,
- **Up / Down arrows:** zoom in/out.

## Features & Changes From The Original

- The ship is now indestructible... But with complete* physics simulation!
(*\* Rotation is not simulated for gameplay's sake*)
- The flat surface of the planet was replaced with a nice, round and **orbitable** planetoid.
